## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript



### What I learned

I have learned a lot of things while making this project. I have learned to implement various DOM properties of Javascript .

Some code snippet for fun ðŸ˜€:

```html
<h1>Let's Settle Dispute with Dicee Game</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-game {
  color: red;
}
```
```js
const learning = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ²')
}
```



### Continued development

I want to improve my Javascript skills and I will be working on it. I will be making more projects using Javascript and will be improving my skills.
